client:- a person who wants to access the website

client sends the request to the server for the data.

blocking -> synchronous

non-blocking -> non-synchronous

🏗️ Node.js Architecture – Explained Simply
Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, designed to handle many requests efficiently, even with a single thread.

🧠 Key Components of Node.js Architecture:
1. V8 Engine (from Google Chrome)
Converts JavaScript code into machine code.

Powers Node.js for fast execution.

2. Single Threaded Event Loop
Node.js runs on a single thread for handling requests.

Unlike traditional servers (which spawn a thread per request), Node.js uses an event loop to handle many requests without blocking.

3. Event Loop
Core of Node.js architecture.

Keeps checking for tasks/events and executes callbacks.

Makes Node.js asynchronous and non-blocking.

4. Event Queue / Callback Queue
Stores pending tasks, like I/O operations, to be processed by the event loop.

5. Worker Threads / Thread Pool (from libuv)
Internally, Node.js uses a thread pool (from the C++ library libuv) to handle:

File system operations

DNS lookups

Compression

Crypto

These tasks are offloaded to worker threads so they don’t block the main thread.

6. Libuv Library
Handles asynchronous I/O.

Manages the event loop and thread pool.

7. APIs & Modules
Built-in modules like fs, http, crypto provide features for building applications.

Node.js uses CommonJS (or ES Modules) to manage them.

🔁 Flow of a Node.js Request:
Client sends a request.

Node.js receives it in the event loop.

If it's a simple task (like math), Node processes it directly.

If it's an I/O task (like file read), it's offloaded to the thread pool.

Once done, the callback is pushed to the event queue.

Event loop picks the callback and executes it.

Response is sent to the client.

✅ Advantages of Node.js Architecture
High performance for I/O-heavy tasks

Lightweight and scalable

Handles many requests with minimal resources

Perfect for real-time apps (chat, streaming, APIs)
